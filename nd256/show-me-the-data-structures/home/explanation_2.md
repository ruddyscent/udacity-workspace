The `find_files` function is designed to efficiently search for files within a directory structure. The function leverages a depth-first search (DFS) approach using a stack data structure to manage the directories to be explored. This choice is made to minimize memory usage compared to a breadth-first search (BFS) which would require storing all nodes at the current level before moving to the next.

### Reasoning Behind Decisions:
1. **Stack Data Structure**: A stack is used to implement DFS, which is memory efficient as it only needs to store the path of the current branch being explored. This is particularly useful for deep directory structures.
2. **Iterative Approach**: An iterative approach is chosen over recursion to avoid potential stack overflow issues with very deep directory structures.
3. **File Filtering**: The function includes logic to filter files based on specific criteria (e.g., file extension), ensuring that only relevant files are processed, which improves both time and space efficiency.

### Time Efficiency:
The time complexity of the `find_files` function is $O(N)$, where $N$ is the total number of files and directories in the directory tree. This is because each file and directory is visited exactly once during the search.

### Space Efficiency:
The space complexity is $O(D)$, where $D$ is the maximum depth of the directory tree. This is due to the stack storing the path of the current branch being explored. In the worst case, the stack will store all directories in a single path from the root to the deepest leaf.

Overall, the `find_files` function is designed to be both time-efficient and space-efficient, making it suitable for searching large and deep directory structures.
