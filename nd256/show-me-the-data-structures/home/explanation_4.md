The `is_user_in_group` function is designed to determine if a user is a member of a group or any of its subgroups. The function uses a recursive approach to traverse the group hierarchy, which is represented as a tree structure. Each group contains a list of users and a list of subgroups. The decision to use recursion is driven by the hierarchical nature of the problem, making it a natural fit for tree traversal.

### Reasoning Behind Data Structures
- **Lists for Users and Subgroups**: Lists are used to store users and subgroups because they provide efficient iteration and membership testing, which are essential for checking if a user is in a group or any of its subgroups.
- **Recursion**: Recursion simplifies the traversal of the hierarchical group structure, allowing the function to check each subgroup in a depth-first manner.

### Time Efficiency
- **Worst-case Time Complexity**: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the total number of users and subgroups in the hierarchy. In the worst case, the function may need to check every user and subgroup.
- **Average-case Time Complexity**: The average-case complexity depends on the structure of the group hierarchy and the position of the user within it. If the user is found early, the function can terminate sooner.

### Space Efficiency
- **Space Complexity**: $O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the group hierarchy tree. This is due to the call stack used by the recursive function. In the worst case, the height of the tree is equal to the number of groups, leading to a linear space complexity.

Overall, the recursive approach and the use of lists for users and subgroups provide a clear and efficient solution for checking user membership in a hierarchical group structure.
