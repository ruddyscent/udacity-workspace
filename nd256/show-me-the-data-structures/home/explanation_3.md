The `huffman_encoding` and `huffman_decoding` functions implement Huffman coding, a method for lossless data compression. The design choices and data structures used are aimed at optimizing both encoding and decoding processes.

### Reasoning Behind Decisions:
1. **Frequency Calculation**: A dictionary is used to count the frequency of each character in the input data. This allows for efficient lookups and updates, which is crucial for determining the character frequencies quickly.
2. **Priority Queue**: A priority queue (implemented using a heap) is employed to build the Huffman tree. This ensures that the two nodes with the smallest frequencies are always merged first, which is essential for constructing an optimal Huffman tree.
3. **Recursive Tree Traversal**: Recursion is used to traverse the Huffman tree and generate binary codes for each character. This approach leverages the tree structure effectively and simplifies the code.
4. **String Concatenation**: The encoded data is produced by concatenating the binary codes. This method is straightforward and efficient for generating the final encoded string.
5. **Tree Traversal for Decoding**: The decoding function traverses the Huffman tree based on the bits in the encoded data to reconstruct the original string. This ensures that decoding is both efficient and accurate.

### Time Efficiency:
- **Encoding**: The time complexity of `huffman_encoding` is $O(n \log n)$, where $n$ is the number of unique characters. This includes $O(n)$ for frequency calculation, $O(n \log n)$ for building the Huffman tree using a heap, and $O(n)$ for generating the Huffman codes and encoding the data.
- **Decoding**: The time complexity of `huffman_decoding` is $O(m)$, where $m$ is the length of the encoded data. Each bit in the encoded data is processed exactly once, making the decoding process linear in relation to the size of the encoded data.

### Space Efficiency:
- **Encoding**: The space complexity of `huffman_encoding` is $O(n)$, where n is the number of unique characters. This includes space for the frequency dictionary, the priority queue, the Huffman tree, and the final encoded string.
- **Decoding**: The space complexity of `huffman_decoding` is $O(m)$, where m is the length of the encoded data. This includes space for the decoded string and the Huffman tree.

Overall, the `huffman_encoding` and `huffman_decoding` functions are designed to be both time-efficient and space-efficient, making them suitable for compressing and decompressing data based on character frequencies.
