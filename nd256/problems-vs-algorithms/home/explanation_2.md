The function `rotated_array_search` is designed to find the index of a target number in a rotated sorted array using a modified binary search algorithm. This approach is chosen because it efficiently narrows down the search space by leveraging the properties of the rotated sorted array. The array is divided into two halves, and the algorithm determines which half is properly sorted. Depending on the target number's position relative to the sorted half, the search continues in the appropriate half. This ensures that the search space is halved in each iteration, leading to a time complexity of $O(\log n)$, which is significantly faster than a linear search for large arrays.

The space complexity of `rotated_array_search` is $O(1)$ as it uses a constant amount of extra space, making it highly efficient in terms of memory usage. This combination of logarithmic time complexity and constant space complexity makes the solution both time and space efficient, suitable for handling large datasets effectively.
