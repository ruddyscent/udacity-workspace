In `problem_5.ipynb`, a Trie (prefix tree) data structure is utilized to efficiently manage and query a collection of strings. The Trie is chosen for its ability to provide fast insert and search operations, both with a time complexity of $O(m)$, where $m$ is the length of the word or prefix. This makes it particularly suitable for tasks like autocomplete and prefix-based searches, where quick lookups are essential.

The decision to use a Trie stems from its hierarchical structure, which allows for efficient storage and retrieval of strings with shared prefixes. Each node in the Trie represents a character, and paths from the root to leaf nodes represent complete words. This structure minimizes redundancy by sharing common prefixes among different words, optimizing both time and space complexity.

The space complexity of the Trie is $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of words and $m$ is the average length of the words. This is because each character in each word is stored in a node, but nodes are shared among words with common prefixes, reducing overall memory usage.

In the notebook, the `find` method is used to locate the node corresponding to a given prefix. If the prefix is found, the `suffixes` method retrieves all suffixes that form complete words starting from this prefix. This approach leverages the Trie's structure to efficiently gather all possible suffixes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Trie for prefix-based queries.

Overall, the use of a Trie in this problem ensures that both time and space are optimized, making it an ideal choice for managing and querying large sets of strings with shared prefixes.
