In `problem_7.py`, a Trie-based data structure is utilized to implement a URL router, which efficiently maps URL paths to their corresponding handlers. The `RouteTrie` class is chosen for its hierarchical nature, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of paths with shared prefixes. This structure is particularly effective for routing because it can quickly match segments of a URL path to the appropriate handler, ensuring fast lookups.

The `Router` class initializes with a root handler and a not-found handler, providing default responses for unmatched paths. The `add_handler` method splits the path into segments and inserts them into the Trie, associating the final segment with the provided handler. This ensures that each path is broken down into manageable parts, allowing for efficient insertion and lookup operations.

The `lookup` method also splits the path into segments and traverses the Trie to find the corresponding handler. If no handler is found, it returns the not-found handler. This approach ensures that path resolution is both fast and reliable, with a time complexity of $O(m)$, where $m$ is the number of segments in the path. This linear time complexity is optimal for this problem, as it guarantees quick lookups even for deeply nested paths.

The space complexity of the solution is $O(n \cdot m)$, where $n$ is the number of paths and $m$ is the average length of the paths. This is because each segment of each path is stored in a node, but nodes are shared among paths with common prefixes, reducing overall memory usage. The `split_path` method ensures that paths are consistently split into segments, handling edge cases like trailing slashes effectively.
