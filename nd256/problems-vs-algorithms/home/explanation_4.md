The function `sort_012` in `problem_4.py` is designed to sort an array consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s in a single pass using the Dutch National Flag algorithm. This algorithm is chosen because it efficiently sorts the array in linear time, $O(n)$, by maintaining three pointers (`low`, `mid`, and `high`) to partition the array into three sections: 0s, 1s, and 2s. This in-place sorting method ensures that the space complexity remains $O(1)$, as no additional data structures are used.
